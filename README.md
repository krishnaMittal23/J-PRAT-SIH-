### 1. The Problem
The rising prevalence of fake and forged academic degrees poses a significant threat to academic integrity, employer trust, and public welfare. Traditional verification methods are manual, slow, and susceptible to corruption, creating an urgent need for a robust, scalable, and secure digital solution.

### 2. Our Solution
J-PRAT is a comprehensive platform that provides instant and reliable verification of academic credentials. It employs a two-pronged approach to create a tamper-proof academic ecosystem:

* **For Legacy Certificates:** It uses a sophisticated AI forensics pipeline to analyze scanned documents for any signs of visual tampering or data inconsistency.
* **For Modern Certificates:** It leverages a private blockchain to notarize new certificates, making them mathematically impossible to forge or alter.

### 3. Key Features
* üß† **AI Forensic Analysis:** A suite of specialized AI models (including Siamese Networks) that perform deep visual analysis of a certificate's layout, seal, logo, and signature to detect sophisticated forgeries.
* üìÑ **Intelligent Dual-OCR:** A cost-effective OCR strategy that uses high-performance open-source models as a baseline and intelligently falls back to state-of-the-art cloud services (like AWS Textract) for complex documents or low-confidence extractions.
* üîó **Immutable Blockchain Notarization:** Utilizes Hyperledger Fabric to store a cryptographic hash of new certificates, providing a permanent and unchangeable proof of authenticity.
* üíæ **Robust Database Verification:** Cross-verifies extracted information against official, indexed university records for fast and reliable legacy certificate validation.
* üñ•Ô∏è **Admin Dashboard with Manual Review:** An intuitive dashboard for authorized officials to monitor verification trends and, crucially, a **human-in-the-loop system** to manually review documents flagged as "suspicious" by the AI.

### 4. System Workflow
Our system follows a refined 10-step process for maximum accuracy and efficiency:
1.  **Secure User Upload:** User uploads a certificate via a pre-signed S3 URL, which offloads traffic from our server for scalability.
2.  **Image Preprocessing:** The image is automatically cleaned, deskewed, and normalized to 300 DPI for consistent analysis.
3.  **AI Forensic Analysis:** A Siamese Network analyzes the layout, seal, and logo for structural integrity and similarity to official templates.
4.  **Intelligent Text Extraction:** OCR is performed using a primary/fallback model strategy.
5.  **Text Normalization:** Extracted text is cleaned and standardized using fuzzy matching.
6.  **Database Cross-Verification:** The cleaned text is matched against records in a secure PostgreSQL database.
7.  **Blockchain Verification:** For modern certificates, the document's hash is verified against the Hyperledger Fabric ledger.
8.  **AI Adjudication:** A central engine consolidates all data points to generate a final, weighted result.
9.  **Result & Reporting:** A clear result (Verified, Fake, Suspicious) is presented. Suspicious cases are sent to the Manual Review Queue.
10. **Admin Oversight:** Officials use the dashboard to monitor activity and resolve flagged cases.
